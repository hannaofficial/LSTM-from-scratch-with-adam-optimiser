This is LSTM Model written from scratch I only used numpy lib.
In this repository I will explain each code line by line 
Right now I didn't explain the each line. Once I get Time to write I will update it.

I use data as text of panchatantra stories. I copied data manually from books and blogs available in online

I use ADAM optimiser here previously I guess in the vanilla RNN used Adagrad


I read blogs from colah and adrej to learn the concept of RNN and LSTM and Then I read different codes for LSTM  architecture and finally come up with these
