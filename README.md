This is LSTM Model written from scratch I only used numpy lib.
In this repository I will explain each code line by line 
Right now I didn't explain the each line. Once I get Time to write I will update it.

I use data as text of panchatantra stories. I copied data manually from books and blogs available in online

I use ADAM optimiser here previously I guess in the vanilla RNN used Adagrad


I read blogs from colah and adrej to learn the concept of RNN and LSTM and Then I read different codes for LSTM  architecture and finally come up with these

I couldn't able to train properly in my laptop it heats up really quicky that's I didn't write prediction function code i.e. after training you give some words to model it will predict next nth letter as per instruct in predict func  will be almost same as sample function my code even if you have good gpu facility you can write your own prediction function

Once I gonna train this model in gpu if get access from teacher I will update the predict code also
